THE CRADLE OF WESTERN. THOUGHT: IONIA,

THE birthplace of Greek philosophy was the séa-board of Asia df
Minor and the early Greek philosophers were Ionians. While
Greece itself was in a state of comparative chaos or barbarism,
consequent on the Dorian invasions of the eleventh century B.c.,
which submerged the old Aegean culture, Ionia preserved the
spirit of the older civilisation,! and it was to the Ionian world that
Homer belonged, even if the Homeric poems enjoyed the patron-
age of the new Achaean arjstocracy. While the Homeric poems |
cannot indeed be called a philosophical work (though they are, of »
course, of great value through their revelation of certain stages
of the Greek outlook and way of life, while their educational influ-
ence on Greeks of later times should not ‘be underestimated),
since the isolated philosophical ideas' that occur in the poems are
very far from being systematised (considerably less so than in the
poems of Hesiod, the epic writer of mainland Greece, who por-
trays in his work his pessimistic view of history, his conviction of

the reign of law in the animal world and his ethical passion for
justice among men), it is significant that the greatest poet of
Greece and the first beginnings of systematic philosophy’ beth hy
belong to Tonia. ‘But these two great ‘productions: of Ionian

genius, the poems ‘of Homer and the Tonian cosmology, did not
