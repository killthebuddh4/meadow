"THE CRADLE OF WESTERN THOUGHT: IONIA"
"THE birthplace of Greek philosophy was the sea-board of Asia"
"Minor and the early Greek philosophers were Ionians. While"
"Greece itself was in a state of comparative chaos or barbarism,"
"consequent on the Dorian invasions of the eleventh century B.C.,"
"which submerged the old Aegean culture, Ionia preserved the"
"spirit of the older civilisation, and it was to the Ionian world that"
"Homer belonged, even if the Homeric poems enjoyed the patron-"
"age of the new Achaean aristocracy. While the Homeric poems"
"cannot indeed be called a philosophical work (though they are, of"
"course, of great value through their revelation of certain stages"
"of the Greek outlook and way of life, while their educational influ-"
"ence on Greeks of later times should not be underestimated),"
"since the isolated philosophical ideas that occur in the poems are"
"very far from being systematised (considerably less so than in the"
"poems of Hesiod, the epic writer of mainland Greece, who por-"
"trays in his work his pessimistic view of history, his conviction of"
"the reign of law in the animal world and his ethical passion for"
"justice among men), it is significant that the greatest poet of"
"Greece and the first beginnings of systematic philosophy both"
"belong to Ionia. But these two great productions of Ionian"
"genius, the poems of Homer and the Ionian cosmology, did not"
"merely follow on one another; at least, whatever view one holds"
"of the authorship, composition and date or dates of the Homeric"
"poems, it is clear enough- that the society reflected in those poems"
"was not that of the period of the Ionian cosmology, but belonged"
"to a more primitive era. Again, the society depicted by Hesiod,"
"the later of the \"two\" great epic poets, is a far cry from that of"
"1"
"\"It was in Ionia that the new Greek civilisation arose: Ionia in whom the old"
"Aegean blood and spirit most survived, taught the new Greece, gave her coined"
"money and letters, art and poesy, and her shipmen, forcing the Phoenicians from"
"before them, carried her new culture to what were then deemed the ends of the"
